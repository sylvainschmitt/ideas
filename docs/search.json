    "text": "Amazon (NW)\nFollowing Butt et al. (2023), we used land surface temperature (LST) data from MOD11A2 version 6 MODIS 8-d LST data up-scaled at 0.05-degree resolution grid. We excluded data where the estimated emissivity error was greater than 0.02 and where the LST error was greater than 1 K. Extensive cloud cover can reduce the spatial and temporal availability of satellite data. For this reason, we focus our analysis on the dry season when there is less cloud cover. We thus worked with the driest month computed independently for each cell and each year based on CHIRPS data (see precipitation section). Dry season surface temperature changes were then calculated by comparing temperature of the driest month for two periods at the end (2020 to 2022) and start (2001 to 2003) of the study period. Using 3-y averages reduces the influences of climate variability. We computed variations in mean temperature. Monthly or seasonal indices could be used at a later stage, but we must also include seasonal variations across space. Daily extrema could also be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparisons\nComparing deforestation surfaces to climate anomalies seems to indicate an increase in temperature with increasing deforestation surfaces. But caution should be taken because of possible spatial proximity between deforested pixels that could confound with the spatial structure of climate anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear regressions\nClassic linear regression without accounting for spatial autocorrelation found no general trend in temperature, but a significant increase in mean temperature of the dryest month (+0.23°C) per deforested \\(km^2\\) in cells of ca. \\(25 km^2\\). Inspecting models residuals revealed a significant spatial autocorrelation but below 0.2 up to several hundred of kilometres questioning the robustness of the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n \ntas\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nCI\np\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.03\n-0.11 – 0.05\n0.402\n\n\ndeforest\n0.23\n0.20 – 0.26\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nObservations\n3851\n\n\nR2 / R2 adjusted\n0.072 / 0.072\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial regressions\nTo account for spatial autocorrelation, we took advantage of a method including spatial autocorrelation in model error (CAR, conditional autoregression see note below).

This definition captures the rapid transition from a lower to higher rainfall regime associated with the DSE, and vice versa for the DSA. The DSE and DSA are not influenced by any bias of rainfall amount, as long as the temporal patterns of the rainfall variation are not affected. Similar definitions have been widely used in the literature (18, 19, 23). For analysis of models, we modify our criterion to five out of eight pentads to best match the modeled DSE and DSA with observations.\n\nWe observed no trend of any metrics that did not encouraged us to explore a link between forest cover and dry season characteristics at a larger scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFu, Rong, Lei Yin, Wenhong Li, Paola A.

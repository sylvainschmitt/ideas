We focused on pixels categorized as undisturbed forest in 2001 and assessed if they were (1) undisturbed, (2) degraded or (3) deforested in 2020. We aggregated the resulting map to 0.01-degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nFollowing Butt et al. (2023), we used land surface temperature (LST) data from MOD11A2 version 6 MODIS 8-d LST data at 0.01-degree resolution grid. We excluded data where the estimated emissivity error was greater than 0.02 and where the LST error was greater than 1 K. Extensive cloud cover can reduce the spatial and temporal availability of satellite data. For this reason, we focus our analysis on the dry season when there is less cloud cover. We thus worked with January the driest month in Guiavare. Dry season surface temperature changes were then calculated by comparing temperature of the driest month for two periods at the end (2015 to 2020) and start (2001 to 2006) of the study period. Using 5-y averages reduces the influences of climate variability. We computed both variations in mean temperature (tas), maximum temperature (tasmax), and minimum temperature (tasmin). As a final preprocessing step, we used forest change classification to keep only pixels undisturbed, degraded or deforested in 2020. Our final dataset comprised n=~74 thousands pixels (1 km2 in extent) over the Guiavare region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nFor each variable we first realised an analysis of variance of temperature variation against forest change types associated to a Tukey honest significant difference test. To account for spatial autocorrelation, we further realised a linear regression with spatial random effect using a matern covariance and inferred with maximum likelihood on a subset of a thousand pixels. We tested for autocorrelation in residuals of both models Moran’s coefficients for 20 distance classes."

However, this results are not robust as the autocorrelogram revealed significant positive spatial autocorrelation up to 160-km. The difference might only be due to the globally higher precipitation of the north or the fact that open land may in fact temporarily increase precipitation by breaking the east to west water flux over Amazonia (add ref).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear regression with spatial random effect (LRSRE)\n\nThe LRSRE revealed only effect centred on 0, suggesting that spatial autocorrelation explains all observed patterns."

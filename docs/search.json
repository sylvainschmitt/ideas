The aim is to build climate indices related to land use change in Capricho (red). We will work at two scales: Capricho & Colombian Amazon. Unfortunately, only two weather stations data are available for the Amazon on the daily data of the Global Historical Climatology Network, and they are far away from our study regions (but could still be used for a bit of validation of remotely sensed products)."

This definition captures the rapid transition from a lower to higher rainfall regime associated with the DSE, and vice versa for the DSA. The DSE and DSA are not influenced by any bias of rainfall amount, as long as the temporal patterns of the rainfall variation are not affected. Similar definitions have been widely used in the literature (18, 19, 23). For analysis of models, we modify our criterion to five out of eight pentads to best match the modeled DSE and DSA with observations. Fu et al. (2013)"
